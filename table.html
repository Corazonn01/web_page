    <tr>
        <td>Code Editors</td>
        <td>As the coders we have to code somewhere. The problem is that there are a lot of different types of the platforms where we can code. A coder spends a lot of time with pc that is why that is crucial to choose a reliable and useful platform for coding. Moreover, there are a lot of tools for that. My favorite is WebStorm. However, a web developer as well can use VS code, that is cool too.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Vision Control System</td>
        <td>While we are working as a team we should know how to communicate well and without any problems that can appear in the future. There are several ways of how the coders can communicate and share their codes. One of them is a Git. Via this sys the coders can see the changes in the code that another person has done. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Front and assets</td>
        <td>Once we created a useful sus for communication and share the code with other developers, we can start to think how to make the code better. One of the way of how to do it , it is making the font readable </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Front end Frameworks</td>
        <td>There are several packages that can make the code better and more beautiful. That is why we should know how to use them properly.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>CSS preprocessor</td>
        <td>CSS - that is a big boss in the design area. With this tool we can decorate our page however e want. That is why CSS is a good helper in the web programming area. No need to think that is useless</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>JavaScript Frameworks / Libraries</td>
        <td>JavaScript - is another useful tool in programmer pocket. That may seem strange, but once you understand of how to use it we can create really amazing and dynamic things.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Online coding Environments</td>
        <td>Meanwhile, we can use CSS, HTML and JS , still there are a lot of other useful tools that we have to learn. They can make the life of a coder easier. </td>
